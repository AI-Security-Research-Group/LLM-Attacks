# Data Poisoning

## Overview
Data poisoning is a type of attack where an adversary intentionally corrupts the training data used to build a machine learning model. This can lead to compromised model accuracy, altered behavior, or the introduction of specific biases, ultimately resulting in harmful decisions or actions by the model.

## Description
Data poisoning involves the injection of malicious data into the training dataset. The objective is to influence the model's learning process, causing it to make incorrect predictions or behave in unintended ways. This type of attack can be particularly damaging as it undermines the integrity of the model from the ground up.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Intentional Corruption**: Deliberate manipulation of training data to deceive the model.
- **Subtlety**: Malicious data may be indistinguishable from genuine data to human observers.
- **Widespread Impact**: Can affect all predictions made by the compromised model.

## Types
Data poisoning can be categorized based on the attacker's goals and methods:

1. **Label Flipping**: Changing the labels of certain training examples to incorrect values.
2. **Feature Manipulation**: Altering the feature values of training examples to introduce bias.
3. **Backdoor Attacks**: Embedding hidden patterns in the training data that trigger specific behaviors in the model.
4. **Targeted Poisoning**: Aiming to degrade the model's performance on specific tasks or inputs.

## How to Determine If You Are Vulnerable
To assess your vulnerability to data poisoning, consider the following steps:

1. **Data Source Verification**: Ensure the integrity and authenticity of your data sources.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Implement mechanisms to detect unusual patterns or anomalies in the training data.
3. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate the model's performance under potential data poisoning scenarios.

## How to Protect from Vulnerability
Protecting against data poisoning requires a combination of preventative and detective measures:

1. **Data Validation**: Rigorously check and validate incoming training data for inconsistencies and anomalies.
2. **Robust Training Algorithms**: Use algorithms designed to be resistant to data poisoning, such as robust statistical methods.
3. **Regular Audits**: Perform regular audits of the data pipeline and training datasets.
4. **Adversarial Training**: Train models with a mix of clean and adversarial examples to improve robustness.
5. **Monitoring and Detection**: Implement continuous monitoring of data integrity and use tools to detect and mitigate poisoning attempts.

## Examples
### Example 1: Label Flipping
An attacker might change the labels of a subset of training images from "cat" to "dog". As a result, the trained model might misclassify cats as dogs.

### Example 2: Feature Manipulation
In a financial fraud detection system, an attacker could manipulate the features of legitimate transactions to resemble fraudulent ones. This could lead to many legitimate transactions being incorrectly flagged as fraud.

### Example 3: Backdoor Attack
An attacker could inject images with a specific pattern (e.g., a sticker) into the training data, labeled as a particular class. The trained model would then classify any image with that pattern as the specific class, regardless of its actual content.

## Overview
Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models that an attacker has intentionally designed to cause the model to make a mistake. These inputs are often imperceptible to humans but can significantly alter the model's predictions. Adversarial examples exploit the weaknesses in a model's understanding, leading to incorrect and often harmful decisions.

## Description
Adversarial examples involve subtle modifications to the input data, such as images, text, or audio, which deceive the model into producing incorrect outputs. These perturbations are usually small and tailored to the specific weaknesses of the model. The primary goal is to manipulate the model's behavior without obvious changes that would be noticeable to humans.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Small Perturbations**: Minor changes to the input that are almost invisible to human observers.
- **Targeted**: Crafted to deceive a specific model or set of models.
- **High Impact**: Can lead to significant errors in the model's output, affecting the reliability and safety of AI systems.

## Types
Adversarial examples can be categorized based on their goals and methods:

1. **Targeted Adversarial Examples**: Aim to cause the model to classify an input as a specific, incorrect class.
2. **Untargeted Adversarial Examples**: Cause the model to misclassify an input without targeting a specific incorrect class.
3. **White-Box Attacks**: The attacker has full knowledge of the model, including its architecture and parameters.
4. **Black-Box Attacks**: The attacker has no knowledge of the model's internals and only uses input-output pairs to craft adversarial examples.

## How to Determine If You Are Vulnerable
To determine if your models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, consider the following steps:

1. **Evaluate Model Robustness**: Test your model with known adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to see if it can withstand perturbations.
2. **Adversarial Training**: Include adversarial examples in the training process and observe if the model's performance improves against such inputs.
3. **Audit and Penetration Testing**: Regularly audit your AI systems with adversarial testing tools and frameworks.

3. **Model Inversion Attacks**: Inferring the input values used during training.
4. **Membership Inference Attacks**: Inferring whether a specific data point was part of the training set.
5. **Query Manipulation Attacks**: Injecting malicious queries into the system.

## Moderately Likely and Severe (6-12)

6. **Model Extraction Attacks**: Reverse-engineering or stealing outputs from the legitimate system.
7. **Transfer Learning Attacks**: Attacking the transferred knowledge from one task to another.

12. **Indirect Prompt Injection**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems that use LLMs as components.

## Less Likely and Less Severe (13-19)

13. **Model Fairness Attacks**: Attacking the model's fairness or bias by manipulating input data.
14. **Model Explainability Attacks**: Evasion attacks that aim to avoid being interpreted by humans.
15. **Robustness Attacks**: Attacking the model's robustness against various types of attacks.
16. **Security Attacks**: Compromising sensitive data or hijacking model outputs.
17. **Integrity Attacks**: Tampering with the model's architecture, weights, or biases.
18. **Jailbreaking Attacks**: Attempting to bypass an LLM's ethical constraints or content filters.
19. **Training Data Extraction**: Inferring specific training data through carefully crafted queries.

## Least Likely and Less Severe (20-26)

20. **Synthetic Data Generation Attacks**: Generating synthetic data to compromise models.
21. **Model Stealing from Cloud**: Extracting a copy of the model without direct access.
22. **Model Poisoning from Edge**: Poisoning models with malicious data at edge devices.
23. **Model Drift Detection Evasion**: Evading detection mechanisms monitoring model performance.
24. **Adversarial Example Generation with Deep Learning**: Generating adversarial examples using deep learning techniques.
25. **Model Reprogramming**: Repurposing a model for a task it wasn't originally intended for, potentially bypassing security measures.
26. **Thermal Side-Channel Attacks**: Exploiting temperature changes in hardware during model inference to infer sensitive information.

## Rare and Least Severe (27-33)

27. **Transfer Learning Attacks from Pre-Trained Models**: Poisoning pre-trained models with malicious data.
